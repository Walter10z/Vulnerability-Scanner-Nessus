# Vulnerability Management with Tenable Nessus
![Nessus](https://github.com/Walter10z/Vulnerability-Scanner-Nessus/assets/102203609/149a6e2e-18b1-43ee-bf74-05f3d03accd3)

# Overview

Within this project, Azure serves as the platform for crafting a Windows Virtual Machine (VM), subject to scrutiny through both non-credential and credential scans. The Windows operating system deliberately maintains outdated versions, manifesting numerous vulnerabilities. The Nessus Vulnerability Scanner is instrumental in illustrating the imperative nature of system updates and proposes viable remediation strategies.

To underscore the importance of appropriately setting up vulnerability scans, two distinct scans were executed. Initially, an unauthenticated scan was carried out on the VM. Subsequent to the completion of the unauthenticated scan, a credentialed scan was configured and launched. Remediations to address significant vulnerabilities were then implemented based on the results of the credentialed scan.

A conclusive credentialed scan was performed to validate the efficacy of the implemented remediations.

# Technologies being used and Azure Specs
  -Windows 10 Virtual Machine
  
  -Tenable Nessus Vulnerability Scanner

# Nessus Scanning a Unauthenticated Virtual Machine
First, generate a virtual machine with Windows 10, ensuring that the firewall is disabled to permit Nessus to conduct a scan on the virtual machine. Then, Nessus will conduct the unauthenticated scan and will show the results. 

# Results of the Unauthenticated Scan
As the scan is conducted in an unauthenticated manner, the identified vulnerabilities may not precisely mirror the known vulnerabilities present on the machine. The outdated operating system on the virtual machine remains unnoticed in this scan, attributing to the inherent limitations associated with unauthenticated scans.

# Credentialed Scan
The Authentication method box requires the inclusion of both the username and password to perform a credentialed scan.

# Overall results of the Credentialed Scan
The contrast in vulnerabilities uncovered between the unauthenticated and credentialed scans is immediately evident. In the unauthenticated scan, Nessus identified only 18 informational "vulnerabilities," which are not genuine vulnerabilities but rather factual statements about the scanned system. In contrast, the credentialed scan revealed 82 critical vulnerabilities, 116 high vulnerabilities, and 27 medium vulnerabilities.

The credentialed scan facilitated a comprehensive evaluation of the system, enabling Nessus to pinpoint vulnerabilities, including those within the outdated OS, and old Firefox version. For deeper insights into the vulnerabilities, Nessus empowers users to expand the details of any specific vulnerability.
